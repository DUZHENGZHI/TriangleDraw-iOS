# TriangleDraw: Pixel Editor for iPad/iPhone

TriangleDraw is brilliant for sketching logos. You can quickly create designs 
that can be used for branding on letterheads or on your website.

### Primary features:

- Draw: use one finger to draw black/white triangles.
- Pinch: use two fingers to zoom.


### Secondary features:

- Browser: Organize your drawing files in directories. Rename. Duplicate.
- Canvas: There are 11616 triangles; you have plenty of space for all kinds of symbols/logos.
- Rotate the canvas by 60 degrees.
- Flip the canvas around the x axis or the y axis.
- Invert, so white becomes black and black becomes white.
- Move the canvas by one column/row. The triangles wraps around the canvas edge.
- Symmetry modes: x, y, xy, 3 way, 6 way.
- Subdivide: Split up all triangles into smaller triangles.
- Undo: If something goes wrong, then you can roll back to the moment just before it went wrong.
- Fullscreen: Hide the toolbars and work without noise.
- Export to vector: Supports both PDF and SVG.
- Export to bitmap: A 2048x2048 image that can be saved to the photo album or shared on social media.
- Free: The app doesn't cost anything.
- OpenSource: You can modify the code.
